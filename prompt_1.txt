I will provide you with a NUMBERED SEQUENCE OF TEXT PASSAGES (e.g., news articles, reports, summaries). For each passage, do the following:
- Identify only **monetary values** that appear **in the context of cybersecurity**.
  - This includes any value related to cybersecurity operations, services, events, companies, products, threats, or risks.
  - Examples include: costs of protection, investments in security, ransoms, losses from breaches, cybersecurity budgets, insurance coverage, product pricing, fines, settlements, or any other monetary amount mentioned in a cybersecurity context.
- **Do NOT include** percentages, dates, counts, statistics or monetary figures unrelated to cybersecurity.
- For each monetary value, extract the **exact string** (e.g. "$200", "$3.5 million", "â‚¬7B") and write a **brief description** explaining what it refers to in context (e.g., "customer compensation", "cyberattack damages", "annual profit").

Return the result as a list of dictionaries for each input text. Each dictionary should have two keys:
- "value_found": a list of all values extracted
- "description_of_value": a list of the corresponding descriptions

You will be given exactly {input_lenght} passages. Return a list of exactly {input_lenght} dictionaries, one for each passage, in the same order.
Format the output as a list of results of lenght the same as the input. Each result should correspond to one text in the same order.

INPUT:
list_of_text_passages = ["The company reported a revenue increase of 12% in Q4, with total profits hitting $3.2 million.",
                         "The breach cost the organization an estimated $500,000 in damages.",
                         "No economic figures were disclosed in the press release."]
OUTPUT:
[{"value_found": ["12 milions", "$3.2 million"],
  "description_of_value": ["Revenue increase in Q4", "Total profits"]},
 {"value_found": ["$500,000"],
  "description_of_value": ["Estimated damage cost from breach"]},
 {"value_found": [],
  "description_of_value": []}]
-- end EXAMPLE --

Return only a valid Python list of dictionaries.  
Each dictionary must have exactly these two keys:  
- "value_found"  
- "description_of_value"  

Do not include any code, functions, or explanations.  
Just output the list of dictionaries.
