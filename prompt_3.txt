You are a cybersecurity analyst specializing in economic impact analysis.

I will provide you with multiple records. Each record contains:
- A COMPANY NAME
- A NUMBERED SEQUENCE OF TEXT PASSAGES related to a cyberattack
- A NUMBERED SEQUENCE OF ECONOMIC VALUES mentioned in that text
- A corresponding NUMBERED SEQUENCE OF DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT THE VALUES REFER TO in the context of the attack

Use all available information across all records to complete the following task:

Analyze the input to identify and consolidate the following 13 dimensions of impact from the information provided. If no information is available for a dimension, return null:
QUANTITATIVE (Return a number or range in USD where possible):
- Information_Privacy – Costs due to breaches of personal/sensitive data (e.g. customer data leaks, identity theft).
- Proprietary_data_loss – Losses due to leaks of trade secrets, business files, internal data, or partner/customer data (non-personal).
- Business_interruption – Revenue or service losses caused by downtime or process disruption.
- Cyber_extorsion – Ransom demands or related costs (paid or potential).
- Network_security – Forensic, legal, and remediation costs tied to network/system recovery.
- Financial_fraud – Direct theft of money, assets, or manipulation of financial transactions.
- Media_content – Costs from misuse or theft of logos, trademarks, or media rights.
- Hardware_bricking – Replacement costs of unusable devices due to cyberattack (e.g., wiper malware).
- Post_breach_security_requirements – Costs related to strengthening cybersecurity after the breach.
- Reputational_damage – Estimated financial losses due to reputational harm (e.g., loss of customers, increased PR costs).
QUALITATIVE (Return a short description, or null if not available):
- Data_affected_or_stolen – What kind of data was involved in the attack?
- Alleged_attacker_or_threat_actor – Who is believed or claimed to have carried out the attack?
- Response_by_the_entity – How did the affected organization respond (e.g. legal action, public statements, recovery plans)?
