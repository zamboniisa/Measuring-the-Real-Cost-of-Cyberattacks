I will give you:
- A COMPANY NAME
- A NUMBERED SEQUENCE OF TEXT PASSAGES (e.g., article snippets, headlines, or report summaries)

For each passage, answer the question:
- Does this passage describe a cybersecurity attack (e.g., hacking, phishing, malware, ransomware, system breach) that is specifically related to the company named?

Return a list with one number per text:
- 1 if the passage is about cybersecurity attacks 
- 0 if it is not

Given the input sequence of lenght {input_lenght}, return only the list of 1s and 0s in the same order as the input of the same lenght of the original texts sequence.
Do not return any kind of text other than the list.

-- start COMPANY NAME --
{company_name}
-- end COMPANY NAME --

-- start NUMBERED SEQUENCE OF TEXT PASSAGES --
{numbered_sequence_of_text_passages}
-- end NUMBERED SEQUENCE OF TEXT PASSAGES --

-- start EXAMPLE --

numbered_sequence_of_text_passages = " 1. The new malware targets hospital systems and encrypts patient data. 2. Apple released its quarterly earnings report showing a 10% increase in profit. 3.Researchers found vulnerabilities in router firmware that allow remote exploitation."
